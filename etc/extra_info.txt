  Up to now, extra info was used to judge whether
the sprite is a custom sprite or not.

  In this tool, the meaning of extra info changes and
use it as a group number of sprite. You can specify
the group number between 0 and 3.



[Sprite type]

  Up to now, the sprite type was judged by sprite number.

  In this tool, you can specify sprite type in config file.
So, for example, you can insert generator sprite into
sprite number 0.
