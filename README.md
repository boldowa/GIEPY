# GIEPY

This is a sprite insertion tool for Super Mario World ROM.

Main program is written in C language.  
And the main patches are assembly file for Asar.


## Feature

This tool has the features like sprite tool, but has the following enhancements.

- More than 600 sprites can be inserted. (Including replacement of existing sprites, up to 984 can be inserted.)

- Any type of sprite can be inserted into an arbitrary number. (For example, you can insert generator into sprite number 0.)

- Added new type sprites ... **Initializer**, **Scroller**


Since the meaning of the extra-bits has been changed so far, attention is necessary.

However, there is also a way to use it as before.
